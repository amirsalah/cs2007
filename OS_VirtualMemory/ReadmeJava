This skeleton is provided to help you focus on the task of managing page
tables and implementing different replacement strategies.

You don't need to modify Memsim.java or MMU.java, only to implement the
 3 replacement strategies by EscMMU.java, LruMMU.java, RandMMU.java

If you feel you  need to, you can do minor changes to the MMU.java interface 
 and modify Memsim.java accordingly. Please, do not modify the output
of the quiet mode, as this will be used for testing.
